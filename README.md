# parking-meter-hci
Part of the UI/UX project; an alternate take on the Parking Meter Interfaces in North America


Hey! 

Some quick pointers (and we will keep updating these over time..)

- Please take a quick peek at the mockups initally to convey the idea of the design flow


Dev Guidelines
- Create a copy of the project on your machine (preferably in the same folder at the git repo) so that if you commit some boo-boo then you immediately know that you can revert back one commit (assuming that your flow is to implement in your local version first and then committing that to the repo). I suggest this because when you are new to git, it can be a bit hard to rectify a mistake (but we all learn quick!)
